I"Ò<p>â€œSpending time with writers in the woods along the Mattawa River was a balm for my literary soul.</p>

<p>I loved sharing conversations about how books and nature inspire us, and discussing publishing opportunities with experienced and aspiring writers alike.</p>

<p>The Mattawa River Writersâ€™ Festival is a wonderful addition to the region and the larger Indigenous literature and CanLit communities.â€ â€“ Amanda Lewis, Editorial Director at Page Two</p>
