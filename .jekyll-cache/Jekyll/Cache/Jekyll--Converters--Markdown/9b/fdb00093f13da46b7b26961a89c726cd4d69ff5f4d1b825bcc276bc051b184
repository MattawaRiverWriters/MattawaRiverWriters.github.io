I"∫<p>‚ÄúDays spent celebrating words in the woods, to paraphrase Thoreau, are days not subtracted from the sum of one‚Äôs life. If books are portals into other lives, other ways of being, so too is the natural world: what a joy to bring them together on the banks of the Mattawa River.‚Äù - Kate Harris</p>

<p>Come to the woods and be nature inspired.</p>

<p><a href="https://kimfahner.wordpress.com/">Kim Fahner</a>, Sudbury poet laureate 2016-18, will facilitate an eco-poetry writing workshop on Friday April 24. Together we‚Äôll consider the interconnectedness that exists between humans and the natural world. We will look at a couple of nature-based poems and discuss what qualities makes a ‚Äògood poem‚Äô in terms of structure and content, and then we‚Äôll head out for a short hike in the woods as a way to spur our creative writing process.</p>

<p>Reflect on the workshop with new friends around a campfire then retreat to peace in one of our <a href="https://www.canadianecology.ca/cabin-rentals/">cabins</a>.</p>

<p>Next morning, Terry Anne Campbell will provide a storytelling workshop. Around the circle we will tap into the power of the spoken word. You will have the opportunity to play with oral storytelling, mining sources from everyday anecdotes to traditional stories.</p>

<p>Explore the forest and then return after lunch to the main building for cocktails, appetizers, conversation and our silent auction to support <a href="https://www.canadianecology.ca/donate/">The Canadian Ecology Centre Educational Foundation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shadowdrummers.sitew.ca/Herstory.B.htm#Herstory.B">The Shadow Drummers</a> will launch our afternoon program with First Nation, traditional, contemporary and original songs from across Turtle Island.</p>

<p>Our writers will speak about how nature influences their work. <a href="https://kimfahner.wordpress.com/">Kim Fahner</a>, <a href="http://www.pedlarpress.com/these-wings-by-kim-fahner/">These Wings</a> published by Pedlar Press, <a href="https://andrewgforbes.com/">Andrew Forbes</a>, <a href="https://invisiblepublishing.com/product/lands-and-forests/">Lands and Forests</a> published by Invisible Publishing and <a href="https://www.harpercollins.ca/author/cr-193890/karen-mcbride/">Karen McBride</a>, <a href="https://www.harpercollins.ca/9781443459679/crow-winter/">Crow Winter</a> published by Harper Collins.</p>

<p>Enjoy a homemade meal at our beautifully set communal tables with Terry, Kim, Andrew and Karen.</p>

<p>Make sure you take the opportunity to purchase the authors‚Äô books and get them signed.</p>

<p>To complete the day, everyone is invited to gather at the campfire under the starry sky. <a href="https://www.northernontario.travel/author/backroads-bill-steer">Back Roads Bill</a> is renown for lighting a fire worthy of the stories we will have heard that day. To enrich our evening we‚Äôll go on a guided night hike with <a href="https://garybarwin.com/">Gary Barwin</a> who will share one of his poems with us next to the Mattawa River.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, join us for a hearty breakfast in Birch Building and then Back Roads Bill will take us on a guided hike which will be the perfect book ending to a weekend with writers in the woods.</p>
