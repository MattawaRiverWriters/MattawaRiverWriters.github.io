- name: Hilary Cunningham Scharper
  brief_about: Perdita
  about: HILARY CUNNINGHAM SCHARPER’s current writing project is a two-volume tale unfolding in the haunted (and haunting) landscapes of the Great Lakes and their remote, 19th-century lighthouses. The first novel, “Perdita,” takes place on the northern Bruce Peninsula at a lighthouse on Georgian Bay (Lake Huron), and tells the tale of a woman purported to be the world’s oldest living person. A ghostly, gothic-hybrid—a child seemingly drowned in an 1898 shipwreck—shadows the boundary between life and death, and impedes the allegedly 134-year-old Marged Brice from passing on. A second novel, “Lonely Island,” is forthcoming. Much of Hilary’s fiction falls within the “Ecogothic,” a newly-minted sub genre of the Gothic tradition. Ecogothic literature embraces the wide range of feelings humans have toward the natural world, including emotions of love and awe as well as fear, alienation, and ambivalence.
