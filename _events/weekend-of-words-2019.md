Thursday evening welcome dinner

Friday we are offering two concurrent workshops.

Workshop No. 1 includes a storytelling workshop to get your creative juices going; how to write the narrative in a story with Helen Humphreys and an insider’s look into book design with Kelly Hill.

Workshop No. 2 is an Advanced Fiction Workshop with Kathryn Walsh Kuitenbrouwer. Your time will be embodied and fun as you’ll be led through a series of exercise and writing games throughout the day.

Friday night after dinner we’ll gather round the campfire for reflections on the day. Saturday is our Family Eco Day Program. Leave the kids with the Canadian Ecology Centre staff for additional activities and dinner as the cocktails begin at 3 pm along with a silent auction to support the Canadian Ecology Centre Education Foundation. Three incredible authors will share how their work is inspired by nature. Dine with Waubgeshig Rice, Helen Humphreys and Kelly Hill. Buy a book and get it signed then gather around the campfire under the stars.

Sunday morning we’ll have a hearty breakfast with Bill Steer aka Back Roads Bill then he will lead us on a guided hike to his favourite places on the property.
