We joined you OUTDOORS wherever YOU were as we roadcast throughout the day on ZOOM.

While we could not come physically together next to the magnificent Mattawa River, we did:
 
·      heard about the work of authors and how nature affects their writing
·      was taken to their ‘sit spot’
·      came together from all parts of the world
·      acquired a new lens on nature
·      participated in a Storytelling Workshop
·      and connected our community with stories.



This was our 5th annual Book Talk fundraiser for the [Canadian Ecology Centre](https://www.canadianecology.ca/)

# TESTIMONIALS

"I had the pleasure of attending two online Mattawa River Writers Festival 2020 events that very much brightened my Earth Day: In the afternoon, Andrew Forbes talked warmly and thoughtfully about his love of nature and his awe of how his kids have embraced the wonders of their backyard, and read from his short-story collection Lands and Forests. And in the evening, Christine Fischer-Guy’s discussion about and reading from her novel The Umbrella Mender was filled with grace and tenderness. As we watched and listened from our homes, Christine stood in her backyard with the sun going down behind her, and the whole thing was such a gentle and heart-lifting communal experience that I felt quite emotional afterwards. During both virtual events, Janet Joy Wilson’s very real warmth and enthusiasm as host shone through and united us in our love of literature and curiosity about the world, providing a welcome respite during these strange, anxious, and isolating pandemic times."  - Jessica Westhead, Author of [Worry](https://www.harpercollins.ca/9781443458856/worry/)

"Wonderful work on yesterday's MRWF, virtual edition! There are a great many entertainments online these days, and your festival pulled in a solid viewership. More than that, you supported CanLit and the CEC and helped us all remember Mother Earth. Brava, lady! Take a bow and a well-deserved rest." - Christine Fischer Guy

Gary Barwin said "It was really great to be able to connect and talk to people outside the radius of my current limited world. And to get to talk about issues around ecology." 

"That was great, and you were a wonderful host. Of course, I'd have preferred that things allowed for us all to gather together, but that was a pretty close second to the real thing."  - Andrew Forbes
