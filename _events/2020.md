Join us OUTDOORS wherever YOU are! Broadcasting throughout the day on ZOOM.

While we cannot come physically together next to the magnificent Mattawa River, you can:
 
·      hear about the work of authors and how nature affects their writing
·      be taken to their ‘sit spot’
·      come together from all parts of the world
·      acquire a new lens on nature
·      participate in a Storytelling Workshop
·      and connect our community with stories.

## Earth Day Schedule

10 am Eastern Time (US and Canada)
<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i> [George Couchie](http://www.nativeawarenesstraining.ca/)
began our Earth Day with a spark, smudging, drumming with his granddaughter Faith and a story about Turtle Island because Culture is Healing.


11:30 am Eastern Time (US and Canada) 
<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Waubgeshig Rice](https://www.waub.ca/about/) author of [Moon of the Crusted Snow](https://ecwpress.com/products/moon-of-the-crusted-snow?_pos=1&_sid=9ef8128d3&_ss=r) published by [ECW Press](https://ecwpress.com/) Waub shared the inspiration for his novel. Additionally, we discussed life imitating art as there are parallels to today's current events.


1 pm Eastern Time (US and Canada)
<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i>  [Terry A. Campbell](https://www.nipissingu.ca/users/terry-campbell)  facilitated a workshop called Storytelling as Medicine. There is a storytelling proverb ... tell me a fact and I'll learn, tell me a truth and I'll believe but tell me a story and it will live in my heart forever.


2:30 pm Eastern Time (US and Canada)
<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i>  [Andrew Forbes](https://andrewgforbes.com/) author of [Lands and Forests](https://invisiblepublishing.com/product/lands-and-forests/) published by [Invisible Publishing](https://invisiblepublishing.com/)
His stories manage to be gritty and elegant at the same time, rendered with Munro-esque mastery and restraint. We discussed his breath-taking collection of short stories. 


6:30 pm Eastern Time (US and Canada)
<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i>  [Gary Barwin](https://garybarwin.com/) author of [For it is a Pleasure and a Surprise to Breath: New and Selected Poems](https://bookstore.wolsakandwynn.ca/products/for-it-is-a-pleasure-and-a-surprise-to-breathe) published by [Wolsak and Wynn](https://www.wolsakandwynn.ca/)
April is National Poetry Month and it was poetic to listen to Gary's poems on his porch.


8 pm Eastern Time (US and Canada)
<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i>  [Christine Fischer Guy](http://www.christinefischerguy.com/) author of [The Umbrella Mender](https://bookstore.wolsakandwynn.ca/products/the-umbrella-mender) published by [Wolsak and Wynn](https://www.wolsakandwynn.ca/)
The sun was setting as we joined Christine in her backyard for an evening reading. Her first novel transported us to 1950s Moose Factory, where a beleaguered staff of the local hospital are fighting to stem the tide of tuberculosis among the indigenous peoples of the North.


9 pm Eastern Time (US and Canada)
<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i>  [Back Roads Bill](https://www.steerto.com/?page_id=72) fired up a virtual campfire for our Earth Day reflections.
