Come to the woods and be nature inspired.

[Kim Fahner](https://kimfahner.wordpress.com/), Sudbury poet laureate 2016-18, will facilitate an eco-poetry writing workshop on Friday April 24. Together we’ll consider the interconnectedness that exists between humans and the natural world. We will look at a couple of nature-based poems and discuss what qualities makes a ‘good poem’ in terms of structure and content, and then we’ll head out for a short hike in the woods as a way to spur our creative writing process. 

Reflect on the workshop with new friends around a campfire then retreat to peace in one of our [cabins](https://www.canadianecology.ca/cabin-rentals/).

Next morning, Terry Anne Campbell will provide a storytelling workshop. Around the circle we will tap into the power of the spoken word. You will have the opportunity to play with oral storytelling, mining sources from everyday anecdotes to traditional stories.  

Escape to your cabin to write or explore the forest and then return in late afternoon to the main building for cocktails, appetizers, conversation and our silent auction to support [The Canadian Ecology Centre Educational Foundation](https://www.canadianecology.ca/donate/).

[The Shadow Drummers](http://www.shadowdrummers.sitew.ca/Herstory.B.htm#Herstory.B) will launch our evening program with First Nation, traditional, contemporary and original songs from across Turtle Island.

Our writers will speak about how nature influences their work. [Kim Fahner](https://kimfahner.wordpress.com/), [These Wings](http://www.pedlarpress.com/these-wings-by-kim-fahner/) published by Pedlar Press, [Andrew Forbes](https://andrewgforbes.com/), [Lands and Forests](https://invisiblepublishing.com/product/lands-and-forests/) published by Invisible Publishing and [Karen McBride](https://www.harpercollins.ca/author/cr-193890/karen-mcbride/), [Crow Winter](https://www.harpercollins.ca/9781443459679/crow-winter/) published by Harper Collins.

Enjoy a homemade meal at our beautifully set communal tables with Terry, Kim, Andrew and Karen.

Before the night is over, you will have an opportunity to purchase the authors’ books and get them signed.  

To complete the day, everyone is invited to gather at the campfire under the starry sky. [Back Roads Bill](https://www.northernontario.travel/author/backroads-bill-steer) is renown for lighting a fire worthy of the stories we will have heard that day.

Sunday morning, join us for a hearty breakfast in Birch Building and then Back Roads Bill will take us on a guided hike which will be the perfect book ending to a weekend with writers in the woods.
