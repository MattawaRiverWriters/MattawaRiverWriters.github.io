“I loved the location from the moment I drove into the park, and enjoyed the people - kindred spirits all - who attended the workshops and readings. The Mattawa is a meeting of waters and this festival, beside that beautiful river, seemed to bring a special group of people together: kindred spirits who care about story and nature - what’s not to love? 

I returned to the city energized and inspired.” - Anne Laurel Carter, Author, Instructor, Editor
