"Days spent celebrating words in the woods, to paraphrase Thoreau, are days not subtracted from the sum of one's life. If books are portals into other lives, other ways of being, so too is the natural world: what a joy to bring them together on the banks of the Mattawa River.” - Kate Harris


Thursday evening welcome dinner

Friday we are offering two concurrent workshops.

Workshop No. 1 includes a storytelling workshop with Terry Anne Campbell to get your creative juices going; how to write the narrative in a story with Helen Humphreys and an insider’s look into book design with Kelly Hill.

Workshop No. 2 is an Advanced Fiction Workshop with Kathryn Walsh Kuitenbrouwer. Your time will be embodied and fun as you’ll be led through a series of exercise and writing games throughout the day.

Friday night after dinner we’ll gather round the campfire for reflections on the day. 

Saturday is our free Family Eco Day Program with our environmentally engaging Canadian Ecology Centre staff. Meet the Shadow Drummers whose music is First Nation, traditional, contemporary and original songs from across Turtle Island.

Join us for cocktails in the afternoon along with a silent auction to support the Canadian Ecology Centre Educational Foundation. 

Dine with esteemed authors Waubgeshig Rice, Helen Humphreys and Kelly Hill. Before and after dinner they will speak on how their work is inspired by nature. Before the night is over, buy a book and get it signed. Everyone is invited to gather at the campfire to continue the conversation under the stars.

Sunday morning we’ll have a hearty breakfast with Bill Steer aka Back Roads Bill. He will lead us on a guided hike to his favourite places on the property.

And then it's goodbye until next year.
