While we cannot come physically together next to the magnificent Mattawa River, we can be engaged with the work of authors and how nature affects their writing, come together from all parts of the world, acquire a new lens on the outdoors, and connect our community with stories.

I can't wait to tell you what I'm planning for this year!
