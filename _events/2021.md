While we cannot come physically together next to the magnificent Mattawa River, we can be engaged with the work of authors and how nature affects their writing, come together from all parts of the world, acquire a new lens on the outdoors, and connect our community with stories.

## ANNOUNCING a new series called IN CONVERSATION. 

“Creating connections with our natural world through the arts is more important than ever after these many months of living with uncertainty, stress and sorrow,” Janet Joy Wilson, artistic director of the festival, says. "While participants are not able to come together with writers in the woods, as they have in past years, we can bond remotely."

The In Conversation series will take place over three months with three themes.

Curating this program to discuss topics of aging, children and grief in relation to the outdoors has been simple. It's as a perfect conduit for the author to share their work and how their writing is influenced by nature but then to dig into the subject with an expert will take the audience to a deeper level.
