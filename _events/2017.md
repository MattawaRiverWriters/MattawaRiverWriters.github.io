"Spending time with writers in the woods along the Mattawa River was a balm for my literary soul. 

I loved sharing conversations about how books and nature inspire us, and discussing publishing opportunities with experienced and aspiring writers alike. 

The Mattawa River Writers' Festival is a wonderful addition to the region and the larger Indigenous literature and CanLit communities." â€“ Amanda Lewis, Editorial Director at Page Two
